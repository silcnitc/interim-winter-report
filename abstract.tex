This project proposes a new educational platform for compiler design as an improvisation of the currently existing framework being used at the compiler construction laboratory in our institution. This involves building a compiler for a simple but a non-trivial programming language. We have designed the platform in such a manner that the students would build the compiler in a simple yet systematic method. The process has been broken down into smaller components and implemented stage by stage. Even though this has already been done in theory as well as practice, in our opinion, the correlation between them often goes unnoticed. The different stages have been integrated in such a way that their interlinking is given a lot of importance. This project is aimed at developing a self-sufficient experimental compiler design platform where students can build their own compiler with minimal expert supervision.
