\chapter{Introduction}

This project aims to develop an online self-sufficient educational platform which can be used to tutor students in writing a compiler. The project will provide the students with a roadmap for the development process and guide them along the roadmap with supporting documentation. Using the step-by-step guidance offered by the roadmap, the students will be able to build the compiler under minimal expert supervision.
\\
\\
We have designed the platform assuming that a student before starting to follow the roadmap has a basic knowledge of Data structures, Computer organization and a working proficiency of the C programming language. Being instructional in nature, this project gives the learner an insight into the working of LEX, YACC and the usage of these tools to develop a compiler for SIL (Simple Integer language). The theory involved would be learned on a \textit{need-to-do} basis.
\\
\\
An \textit{in-depth} explanation approach of the compiler design concepts and how these are interlinked with the back-end working of the compiler-generation tools has been used throughout the documentation. We believe that this would enable the students to have a better appreciation for theory.
\\
\\
The primary focus of the project is to provide a platform that would help make the learner experience the process of implementing a functional compiler for a simple language and to provide a foundation for appreciating commercial compilers which the learner may choose to explore beyond this project.
