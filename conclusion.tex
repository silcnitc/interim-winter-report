With the current work progress, the platform can be potentially deployed once the proposed stages of the project in this section have been completed. The exact details of the stages are as follows: 
\section{LEX Documentation}
A LEX document for the lexical analysis phase has been designed, compiled and reviewed. 
\section{YACC Documentation}
A YACC document for the parsing phase has been designed, compiled and reviewed.
\section{LEX-YACC Documentation}
A LEX-YACC document for using YACC effectively with LEX has been designed, compiled and reviewed.
\section{Attributes Documentation}
A document on using the attribute stack of YACC is being designed currently.  
\section{Extensions to SIL}
Language extensions to SIL are currently being designed and are yet to be tested. These include user-defined types, dynamic memory allocation and pointers.
\section{Online Platform}
The development of the mainframe of the website has been completed. All the completed documents are available online. Other components of the website are currently under construction.
