\chapter{Problem Definition}


Compiler design involves a series of stages of development. Currently, an incremental approach is being used in building a compiler in the compiler construction laboratory in our institution. In this methodology, students are trained to develop a compiler for the Simple Integer Language (SIL). Students are expected to develop a compiler to translate the source code of SIL into executable code which is executed using the Simple Integer Machine (SIM). SIL is an experimental programming language which was designed for educational purposes \cite{citation-3-name-here} and SIM is a virtual machine with an elementary instruction set\cite{citation-4-name-here}. The language chosen for implementing the compiler is the C programming language. Compiler generation tools LEX and YACC have been used to aid the students to build the compiler.

In this currently used approach, we found that many students who enrolled for the compiler laboratory course (including ourselves) faced problems with correlating the compiler design theory with the implementation process. In our opinion, the students would be able to comprehend the process better with more educational resources and guidance.

Our project attempts to improvise the currently existing system by designing a new instructional framework consisting of documentation for the compiler construction process and an easy to follow roadmap to guide a student who is in the learning phase.
